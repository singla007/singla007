- ⚡ Fun fact: I am half finnishedI have completed my Master's degree program in Systems Science and Engineering at the University of Ottawa. Prior to this, I held a position as a Senior Software Developer at Infosys, where I gained experience in Big Data, Data Engineering, and Data Science technologies. I have worked with retail clients like Sweetgreen, bimbo, and Starbucks. My latest project was with Sweetgreen, where I developed an ETL pipeline in AWS using Airflow and managed the database using Snowflake. I have handled the live data of more than 2000 stores across the USA and managed databases in hundreds of terabytes. I have also developed a recommendation model to predict the demand and supply of raw materials to the stores. In the internal project of Infosys, I have worked on automated data science platform for Infosys clients. In this project, we have created a tool, especially for people with no coding skills to work on a DS lifecycle - from wrangling, visualization, modeling, AutoML, model tracking, and predicting, to saving the model for future use. In this project, I created the AutoML solution which was capable to do automated data cleaning, feature engineering, and creating end-to-end models using multiple machine learning algorithms like Catboost, LDBM, and XGBoost, etc. I have also obtained an Azure certification as a Data Scientist, and have completed several nano degree programs in Data Science from Udacity. My skills and expertise extend to the design and development of comprehensive solutions in the field of Data Science.
